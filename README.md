# DiabetesAssistant

Cross-platform application to assist individuals with diabetes to better control and manage their intake and medicinal needs. .net MAUI is utilized for user interface, currently operational in Windows Machine and Android emulator 12.1 - 32 API At this time, the application currently supports utilizing [food-data_central_api](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/fdcnal/food-data_central_api/1.0.1#/) to search food and their data using. The app also creates a database using SQL-lite to create tables of relevent food data information. At this time, the app supports one table to save information. 

The hope is that this project will include the following features in its code:
<ul>
<li>Three or more unit tests (not completed)</li>
<li>A dictionary or list, populated with several values, retrieves at least one value, and uses it in the program </li>
<li>Use of SOLID principles</li>
<li>Be an asynchronous application</li>
</ul>

More work is needed to allow for the user to search foods as well as directly use FoodData Central ID numbers to find food facts. Calculator business logic to safely calculate medication management with food intake.
